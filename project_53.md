4. What is the difference between relative positioning and absolute positioning in HTML?

Answer:
Relative positioning :
Relative positioning allows the use of the normal
``` css
  .container {
    display : flex;
    align-items : center;
    justify-content : center;
  }
  
  .item {
    text-align : center;
    position : relative;
    top : 50px;
    left : 50px;
  }
```

```html 
  <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="./index.css">
      </head>
      <body>
        <div class="container">FlexBox Container!
          <button class="item">Hello, this is button which uses positioning.</button>
          <button class="item">Hello, this is button which uses positioning.</button>
        </div>
      </body>
    </html>
```
to position the current object. For example, if in a flex box container, in css, itâ€™s difficult to position elements. We could use relative positioning to fix this problem. This allows us to position the current item using the normal alignment of the current item ie. diverted from the center aligned position.

Absolute positioning:
Absolute Positioning uses the position of a non-static element to position the current element ie. position the element anywhere on the page.
```css 
  .non-static {
    margin : 0 auto;
    color : cornflowerblue;
  }
  
  .absolute {
    position : absolute;
    left: 200px;
    top: 150px;
    color : cornflowerblue;
  }
```

```html 
  <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="./index.css">
      </head>
      <body>
        <button class="non-static">Hello, this is button which uses non static positioning.</button>
        <button class="absolute">Hello, this is button which uses absolute positioning.</button>
      </body>
    </html>
```

5. What is the use of opacity in CSS??
Answer:
Opacity is a property used in css to style placeholders and text differently.
This can be applied to text to make it pop out or look dim.
This would come in handy when there is a button.
```css 
  button {
    color : rgba(0, 140, 255, 0.25);
    background-color : rgba(0, 140, 255, 0.25);
    border : 5px solid cornflowerblue;
  }
  
  button:hover {
    color : rgba(0, 140, 255, 1);
    background-color : rgba(0, 140, 255, 1);
    border : 5px solid cornflowerblue;
  }
```

```html
  <!DOCTYPE html>
    <html>
      <head>
        <link rel="stylesheet" href="./index.css">
      </head>
      <body>
        <button>Hover on me!</button>
      </body>
    </html>
```
